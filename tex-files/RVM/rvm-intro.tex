While smart contracts are capable of being ran on a wide variety of blockchains frequently they are simple and incapable of running complex solutions. Often also requiring a user to write smart contracts in a specialised language. Rasica aims to solve this issue through the extension and improvement of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (SVM) to create the Kat Virtual Machine (RVM) \cite{RVM}. By doing so, Rasica will be compatible with existing smart contracts for the ethereum blockchain written in Solidity to be used on Rasica while allowing more complex algorithms to be run far more simply than exists in the current infrastructure. \\

By extending the range of capabilities that are used on the SVM, we can ensure that significantly more complex operations can be performed by the Rasica network. Furthermore, it will allow users of the network to have easily accessible cryptographic functions that are used on the Rasica Network.
