For the sake of clarity, here is a dictionary of the variables used in the proceeding description of the consensus mechanism:

\begin{itemize}

\item $p$ - A single producer that has been selected randomly to perform work for the network for a given cycle.
\item $P$ - The pool of producers who have been selected through the producer selection mechanism for the particular cycle being described. It is made up of a set of producers $p$.z
\item $T$ - The mempool of any given producer $p$. It contains a group of transactions that will be used in the update for a given cycle.
\item $t$ - A single transaction that is found within the mempool $T$.
\item $u$ - The local ledger state update generated by a single producer node. This is what that particular node believes to be the correct update for the given cycle.
\item $\sigma$ - A pseudorandomly generated number, used as a salt.
\item $d$ - A hash tree containing all the signatures extracted from the transactions in $T$.
\item $H$ - A hash of each list $E$ combined with the salt $\sigma$.
\item $L$ - Alphanumerically ordered list of the pairs $E,H$, sorted according to $H$.
\item $G$ - The list of proposed updates $u$ that producer $p$ collects from other nodes in producer pool $P$. This is used to determine the most popular update.
\item $\#\mathcal{L}$ - The bloom filter of producers from a particular producers' set $G$ that sent the most popular ledger state update.
\item $L_{final}$ - A producers list of compensation entries \textit{i.e.} who a producer believes did the correct work for the network and thereby should be rewarded. This is created from all the combined $\#\mathcal{L}$ received. 
\item $\#\mathcal{L}_{(final)}$ - The bloom filter of producers a specific producer found in $L_{final}$.
\item $LSU$ - Ledger State Update. This is the final ledger state update proposed by a producer node. It consists of the list of transactions used to create the update, the bloom filter or producers who produced the correct partial ledger state update and the users peer ID.

\end{itemize}
