The third phase of the ledger cycle is the Voting phase. In this phase, the producer $p$ collects the $c$ values broadcast by the other producers. By this stage of the consensus algorithm, the only producers that remain should be those that have $h^{maj}$. These recieved $c$ values are incorporated into a set $C$. This set $C$ is used by the producers to determine the complete list of producers that gave the correct update and thereby those that should be rewarded for their contribution. $C_{min}$ is the minimum number of retrieved votes that a producer can have in order to give a valid final update, thereby the producer $p$ continues collecting broadcast votes $c$ until $C \geq C_{min}$. \\


Upon retrieving enough $c$ values from other producers to meet the threshold $C_{min}$, $p$ must again attempt to decode the $u^{maj}$ values contained within its set $C$. This is done as in the campaigning phase. The amount of decoded values must meet the threshold determined by:  

\begin{center} 
$C_{threshold}(99.999\%) = \left( 0.5 + 4.22\sqrt{\frac{C^{dec}(C-C^{dec})}{C}}\right) \times C$
\end{center} 

Where $C^{dec}$ is the number of values that $p$ was capable of decoding. If this threshold is met then it can be assumed that with a 99.999\% certainty that a majority of the $C$ values collected by $p$ were in fact the correct update. In reality this number should be significantly higher if not 100\% due to only the producers who hold the correct update having reached this stage of the consensus algorithm. \\

Upon confirming that $p$ is in the majority, they can now begin to produce the final list of producers that created the correct ledger state update. They, take the $C^{dec}$ subset and extract the bloom filters attached to that set. $p$ also retrieves the list of producers for that specific cycle from the DAO. For each element in the list of producers their membership is checked in each of the bloom filters in $C^{dec}$. If an element from that list appears in more that half of the bloom filters that element is added to a new list $\mathcal{L}_{final}$, upon checking all the elements from the list of producers against the retrieved bloom filters a new bloom filter is created $\#(\mathcal{L}_{final})$ containing all elements determined to have been present in more than half of the bloom filters.
